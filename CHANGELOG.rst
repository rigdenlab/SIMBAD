- Added citation tab to pyvapi

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Changed `-morda_db` argument in `simbad.command_line.simbad-database` and `simbad.command_line` so that it now has a default location and so that after generating the database the `-morda_db` flag doesn't need to be called every time. 
- Fixed a bug in how pointless was called that was changing the a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma order. 
- tidied up clean up function

0.1.13
------

Added
~~~~~
- Added in code that uses pointless to reindex mtz files
- EXE_EXT calls to all executable commands to allow for windows compatibility
- Completely reformatted all pyjob calls to use version 0.2.0 and updated dependencies list.
- Function to get the sequence from a pdb file
- Function to generate ensemble database


Changed
~~~~~~~
- Replaced CCTBX code that checked the columns in the input MTZ with MrBump code as CCTBX was giving errors for certain input MTZs. 
- Replaced `simbad.util.mtz_util.get_labels` with a class called `simbad.util.mtz_util.GetLabels`. This returns more types of input labels and simplifies how the labels are passed into other functions.
- Updated test cases affected by changes
- `simbad.util.mtz_util.GetLabels` was changed to use miller arrays and is therefore more robust when handling columns with non-standard names
- `simbad.rotsearch.phaser_search` changed to rank models by RFZ rather than LLG.

0.1.12
------

~~~~~

- Added SIMBAD paper to docs
- Added output_files directory to store all output files

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Fixed bug in phaser that fixed a problem in check all/enant spacegroups
- Changed molrep/phaser to output an hkl, this is needed for changes of basis as a result of all/enant searches
- Altered the cleanup algorithm to completely remove the mr_search directory and instead rely on the newly created output_files directory
- Altered logging to use enum, closes #81
- Removed eRMSD calculation and changed to use the seqenence identity directly through phaser, therefore using their equation directly. 
- Altered phaser so that it outputs the input MTZ with a basis change instead of the phaser output mtz, due to missing r-free columns 
- Fixed bug in rotation search solution check due to missing argument

0.1.11
------
